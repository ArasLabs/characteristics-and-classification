# Item Characteristics And Classification

Current version: v4-0(A11SP7), v4-1(A11SP9). Adds the assignment of freely defined classification hierarchies to an item (i.e. Part). Class specific characteristics (properties) can be defined and are added to the item based on class selection. Parametric search option to find items by combination of characterstics values is added, as well. v3-0 added configuration of the grid columns in parametric part search. See documentation for more details.

Continue to use v2-0 on Aras 9.4.
